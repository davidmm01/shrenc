# TODO List

- nosql db
  - for recording the history of encrypts and decrypts
  - gui for viewing the history
  - gui option on encrypt/decrypt? to store the secrets or not
- support regular keys, not only symetric
- add option for whether an encryption will batch multiple selected files in a tar together, or put them in separate tars
- make a readme.md
